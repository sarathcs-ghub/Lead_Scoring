# LogisticRegression_Lead_Scoring

Building a machine learning model for Leads Scoring using Logistic Regression

**Business Understanding**

An EdTech company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Visitors browse through the courses in various websites. However, few of them convert into paying customers. The CEO of the company wants to predict based on the various attributes which customers are most likely to "Convert" into a paying customer. The CEO of the company has given a target of 80% as per the case study

Business Objective of the X education is to know most promising leads:

For that they want to build a Model which identifies the hot leads Deployment of the model for the future use

**Approach:**

There are quite a few goals for this case study:

Understand the data and the characteristics/attributes of visitors and leads Build a logistic regression model to assign a score in scale 0 to 100 to each of the leads Identify potential leads Higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert Lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted
